                <h2>Preamble</h2>
                <p>To preface, I am a first-generation child born in the States to two Filipino parents. In the past I
                    would fly out to my mother's home for ever summer vacation. However, up until this past May it had
                    fourteen years since my last visit.</p>
                <p>I had been excited for this trip for the last year, and I wondered just how much of my homeland had
                    changed in the last decade. Were more roads paved in? Did cities have working internet? Were
                    smartphones as prolific in the Philippines as they are now? I would find all that out and more.</p>

                <h2>Zamboanguita</h2>
                <p>Zamboanguita is the home of many of my family members, and where I have spent most of my time while
                    visting the Philippines. To my surprise as I came to visit, fiber internet had become commonplace in
                    the city, and many families had multiple smartphones! </p>
                <p>Phone service in the Philippines mostly consists of loading your phone number with call minutes,
                    data, or a combination of the two. Cell reception varies heavily depending on where you are in the
                    city &mdash; particularly how clear the path is between you and the closest cell tower.</p>

                        raised on posts depending on their proximity to bodies of water or if flooding is common in the
                        area.</figcaption>

                <h2>Dumaguete City</h2>
                <p>I went to school for a year in Dumaguete, and my most vivid memories from childhood are times that I
                    visited a shopping mall with seven large floors. The city has become much more technologically
                    advanced since I've last visited, especially with the inclusion of a much larger mall and many
                    American restaurants that didn't have franchise presence in the company back in the early 2000s!</p>

                <h2>Sipalay & Perth Paradise Resort</h2>
                <p>Sipalay is a fairly popular tourist spot on the island of Negros, dotted with travel resorts that offer customers rides to visit surrounding islands. Its beaches are very clean with beautiful clear waters.</p>
                <p>Visiting the islands was nice and all, but I think the most interesting part of the trip was the fact that I got better cellular reception in the middle of the bay compared to inside the city!</p>
