                <h2>Preamble</h2>
                <p>To preface, I am a first-generation child born in the States to two Filipino parents. In the past I would fly out to my mother's home for ever summer vacation. However, up until this past May it had fourteen years since my last visit.</p>
                <p>I had been excited for this trip for the last year, and I wondered just how much of my homeland had changed in the last decade. Were more roads paved in? Did cities have working internet? Were smartphones as prolific in the Philippines as they are now? I would find all that out and more.</p>

                <h2>Zamboanguita</h2>
                <p>Zamboanguita is the home of many of my family members, and where I have spent most of my time while visting the Philippines. To my surprise as I came to visit, fiber internet had become commonplace in the city, and many families had multiple smartphones! </p>
                <p>Phone service in the Philippines mostly consists of loading your phone number with call minutes, data, or a combination of the two. Cell reception varies heavily depending on where you are in the city &mdash; particularly how clear the path is between you and the closest cell tower.</p>
